    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that expolres the  building block of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elemeents. Each element is represented  by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represnted using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>( H<sub>2</sub> )</i> and oxygen gas <i>( O<sub>2</sub> )</i> to form water <i>( H<sub>2</sub>O )</i>.</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichimetry is the calculation of reactant ans products in chemicalm reactions. It involves balance chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscript</sup>represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of tha air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
